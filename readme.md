# Basic CLI commands
    * go run hello.go - compile & executes file
    * go build hello.go - compiles the file & creates binary
    * go fmt -
    * go install - 
    * go get -
    * go test - 

# Build for multiple platforms

    * env GOOS=windows go build hello.go - creates binary for windows [ hello.exe ]
    * env GOOS=darwin go build hello.go - creates binary for macos [ hello ]
    * file has "package main" - Executable one. Any other name for package will be dependency to other files & reusable code
    * Array - Fixed length
    * Slice - We may increase & Shrink Array length
